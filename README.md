# RockPaperScissorsGame
The script generates a cryptographically strong random key (SecureRandom, RandomNumberGenerator, etc. - mandatory!) with a length of at least 256 bits, makes computes move, calculates HMAC (based on SHA2 or SHA3) from the own move with the generated key, displayes the HMAC to the user. After that the user gets "menu" 1 - Stone, 2 - Scissors, ...., 0 - Exit. The user makes his choice (in case of incorrect input, the "menu" is displayed again). The script shows who won, the move of the computer and the original key.
